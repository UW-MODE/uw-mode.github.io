The [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) is a leader in both [Computer Science](http://www.cs.washington.edu) and [Statistics](https://www.stat.washington.edu), creating a unique institution for performing cutting-edge Machine Learning research.  This [research](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/ml) occurs around many areas of campus, lead by a diverse set of faculty.  The MODE Lab brings together faculty, students, and postdocs in CSE and Statistics.  The focus of the lab is on **M**achine learning, **O**ptimization, **D**istributed systems, and (**E**) statistics (or, for Spanish speakers, Estadística).  Some example topics include:

- streaming inference algorithms
- distributed implementations
- models and algorithms for large-scale time series analysis
- statistical network modeling
- Bayesian nonparametrics
- computational neuroscience
