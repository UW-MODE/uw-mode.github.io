# Exploiting Structure in Piecewise Optimization

Scalable optimization methods are critical for many machine learning applications.
Moreover, many optimization problems exhibit useful structure at the solution.
For example, in sparse regression problems, the optimal model makes predictions using only a subset of features, ignoring the model's remaining inputs completely.
<br />
<br />
The goal of this project is to design principled, efficient, and versatile optimization methods by exploiting the specific structure of a problem.
In particular, we focus on two approaches: working set algorithms and screening tests.
<br />
<br />
At ICML 2015, we introduced a principled working set algorithm called Blitz.  This algorithm achieves state-of-the-art convergence times for sparse regression problems in a number of large-scale settings.
<br />
<br />
Our most recent work presents a unified and more general understanding of working set algorithms and screening methods.
